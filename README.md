# BlueCodec

Speech autoencoder that compresses 44.1 kHz audio into a compact 24-dimensional continuous latent representation at ~86 Hz, then reconstructs the waveform.

## Installation

```bash
uv add "bluecodec @ git+https://github.com/maxmelichov/blue-codec.git"
```

## Usage

See `examples/` folder for a full working example.

## Pretrained Model

The pretrained model was trained on 2x NVIDIA RTX 3090 GPUs for 4 weeks on 6 million files with different languages, totaling about 11,000 hours of audio.

Pretrained weights: [notmax123/blue-codec](https://huggingface.co/notmax123/blue-codec) on Hugging Face.

## Training

For detailed instructions on how to train the Autoencoder, please refer to the [Training Documentation](docs/training.md).
